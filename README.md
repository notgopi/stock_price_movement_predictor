# stock price movement predictor
This model uses Random Forest Algorithm to predict the movement of a stock price in the future. For the decision nodes we use various momentum based indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), Stochastic Oscillator, William %R, MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) etc. which show us the degree of buying and selling of that stock.

1. Predict the movement of a stock...
2. Build dataset
3. Calculate the indicators
4. Random forest classifier
5. Test the model and evaluate various metrics

To predict the movement of a stock even more ahead of time we employ a Time based approach using LSTM model.
